        <div class="about-me__body">
            <p>My passion for digital work began at a young age with photography and film. I was always fascinated by
                the way I could capture moments and tell stories through images. This led me to experiment with
                different techniques and editing tools, and eventually, I found myself drawn to the world of
                programming.</p>
            <p>I started to explore programming and discovered the endless possibilities it offered for creative
                expression. I became captivated by the idea of using code to create animations and interactive
                experiences, and I knew that I wanted to pursue this field further.</p>
            <p>This interest in programming eventually led me to the world of 3D modeling. I was intrigued by the idea
                of creating virtual environments and objects that could be explored and interacted with. I began to
                study 3D modeling and was amazed by the intricate details and lifelike qualities that could be achieved
                with just a computer.</p>
            <p>Now, I am fully immersed in the digital world and I am constantly striving to improve my skills and
                explore new possibilities. I am passionate about creating digital experiences that are both beautiful
                and functional, and I am dedicated to producing work that pushes the boundaries of what is possible in
                this field.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I pursue a variety of interests that keep me both intellectually and physically
                stimulated. Music has always been a major passion of mine, and I enjoy learning music theory and playing
                the guitar and piano. I find that playing music helps me to relax, unleash my creativity, and express
                myself in new ways.</p>
            <p>I am also a big fan of traveling and discovering new places, immersing myself in new cultures, and trying
                new foods. These experiences broaden my horizons and provide a fresh perspective on life. </p>
            <p>Additionally, I am dedicated to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I enjoy cooking nutritious meals and
                regularly engage in physical activity to keep my body and mind in peak condition. Whether through music,
                travel, or fitness, I strive to make the most out of every day and live life to the fullest.</p>

        <div class="about-me__body">
            <p>As a lifelong learner, I am constantly striving to expand my knowledge and skill sets. My passion for
                creativity and technology has driven me to master a wide range of tools and techniques.</p>
            <p>I attended the University of Central Florida to pursue a degree in Game Design. During my time at UCF, I
                gained valuable experience in the field through coursework and various game development projects,
                helping to develop my skills as a 3D artist and game designer.</p>
            <p>I have honed my skills in graphic design by mastering Adobe Photoshop and Premiere, as well as other
                Adobe products. Additionally, I have a basic understanding of the fundamentals of front-end development
                and have worked with React.js libraries.</p>
            <p>In 3D modeling, I have gained expertise in Marmoset Toolbag, Autodesk Maya, 3ds Max, Unity, Unreal
                Engine, Substance Painter, Blender, and ZBrush. These powerful tools have allowed me to bring my ideas
                to life and create visually stunning and functional designs.</p>
            <p>I believe that staying current and well-versed in a variety of fields is essential for success in today's
                rapidly changing world. That is why I am constantly seeking out new learning opportunities and
                challenges to push my boundaries and develop new skills.</p>
