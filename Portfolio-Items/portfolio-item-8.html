            <p>One of my proudest early projects that kickstarted my passion for 3D work is a simple archviz kitchen that I created during my high school years. This project began as a "real or fake" assignment where we were challenged to make our renders look identical to a real image of our choice. I was immediately drawn to the challenge and poured countless hours into perfecting every detail until the final render was as close to the real thing as possible so that I could convince my classmates that my renders were a real photograph. </p>
            <p>The project turned out to be a significant milestone for me, as my teacher had entered me into a district-wide art competition. I was selected to be a candidate where I later presented my work to a panel of judges, explaining my workflow and thought process with a presentation.</p>
            <p> I am proud to say that my dedication and hard work paid off as I received recognition for my project, and took first place in the contest. This gave me the motivation to continue exploring and refining my skills as a visual artist.</p>
