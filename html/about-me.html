        <div class="about-me__body">
            <p>My name is Colby Christopher. My passion for the digital creative field first began at a young age with photography and film. 
                I was always fascinated by the way I could capture moments, relive experiences, and tell stories through images and videos. 
                This led me to experiment with different techniques and editing tools, and eventually, I found myself drawn to the world of programming.</p>
            <p>I started to explore programming and discovered the endless possibilities it offered for creative expression.
                 I became interested in the idea of using code to create websites and interactive experiences, and I knew that I wanted to pursue this field further.</p>
            <p>Around this same time, I was introduced to 3D modeling through a series of high school classes. I was intrigued by the idea of creating virtual enviroments and objects that could be explored and interacted with. 
                I began to study 3D modeling and was amazed by the intricate details and lifelike qualities that could be achieved with just a computer. This was the moment that I fell in love with the world of 3D. </p>
            <p>Now, I am fully immersed in the digital world and I am constantly striving to improve my skills and explore new possibilities. I am passionate about creating digital experiences that are both aesthetically pleasing and functional, 
                and I am dedicated to producing work that pushes the boundaries of what is possible in this field.</p>
            <p>In my free time, I pursue a variety of interests that keep me both intellectually and physically stimulated. Music has always been a major passion of mine, and I enjoy learning music theory and playing the guitar and piano. 
                I find that playing music helps me to relax, unleash my creativity, and express myself in new ways.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I am dedicated to maintaining a healthy lifestyle. I enjoy cooking nutritious meals and regularly engage in physical activity to keep my body and mind in peak condition. Whether through music, travel, or fitness, 
                I strive to make the most out of every day and live life to the fullest.

        <div class="about-me__body">
            <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--applications">Education</p>
            <p>I attended the University of Central Florida to pursue a degree in Digitial Media, on the Game Design Track. During my time at UCF, 
                I gained valuable experience in the field through coursework and various game development projects, helping to develop my skills as a 3D artist and game designer.</p>
            <p>I have honed my skills in graphic design by mastering Adobe Photoshop and Premiere, as well as other Adobe products. Additionally, I have a basic understanding of the 
                fundamentals of front-end development and have worked with React.js libraries.</p>

                <body>
                    <span class="Sphere"></span>

            <p>In 3D modeling, I have gained experience in using Marmoset Toolbag, Autodesk Maya, 3ds Max, Unity, Unreal Engine, Substance Painter, Blender, and ZBrush. These powerful tools 
                have allowed me to bring my ideas to life and create interesting designs.</p>
            <p>
                I am constantly striving to expand my knowledge and skill sets. My passion for creativity and technology has driven me to master a wide range of tools and techniques.
                I believe that staying current and well-versed in a variety of fields is essential for success in today's rapidly changing world. That is why I am constantly seeking 
                out new learning opportunities and challenges to push my boundaries and develop new skills.
